# Welcome to the Automated Temperature Regulation Delivery Box Project!  

## Introduction  
Welcome to our GitHub repository for the **Automated Temperature Regulation Delivery Box**, a project we developed for our **CPE103 Robotics and Automation** course. This project demonstrates our passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, specifically within the food delivery industry.  

## Abstract  
The food delivery industry thrives on convenience, but maintaining food quality during transport remains a significant challenge. This project introduces the **Automated Temperature Regulation Delivery Box**, a solution designed to enhance food delivery services by implementing **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)** control for precise temperature regulation.  

Unlike traditional insulated boxes, this system employs **active temperature regulation** through the integration of **thermoelectric Peltier modules** and **DHT22 sensors**. The box dynamically adjusts cooling and heating to maintain the desired temperature range, ensuring the optimal condition of food during delivery.  

The system features a **user-friendly interface** that enables seamless interaction via mobile devices. Comprehensive testing confirms its effectiveness in maintaining target temperatures for both loaded and unloaded compartments, with the **PID control system** providing superior accuracy compared to conventional methods.  

## Key Features  
- **Dynamic Temperature Regulation**: Real-time control of cooling and heating using PID algorithms.  
- **Thermoelectric Peltier Modules**: Efficient temperature adjustment for both heating and cooling.  
- **DHT22 Sensors**: Precise temperature monitoring for accurate regulation.  
- **Mobile Interface**: Convenient user interaction via mobile applications.  
- **Enhanced Food Quality and Safety**: Ensures food stays fresh and at optimal temperatures during delivery.  

## Impact  
This project showcases the potential of sensor-driven technology to revolutionize the food delivery industry by improving food quality, safety, and overall customer satisfaction.
